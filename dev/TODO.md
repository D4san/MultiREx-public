# MultiREx
## Planetary transmission spectra generator
### To Do list

This is a list (a very incomplete one) with some of the features awaiting to be incorporated in `MultiREx`:

- Implement a mechanism to generate properties of the system that are physically or statistically dependent (see https://github.com/D4san/MultiREx-public/blob/main/dev/use-cases.ipynb for details)

- Opacities:
  - Download all the opacities of Exotranmit.
  - Download more opacities from Exomol, especially for other molecules of interest for Hot Jupiter research.
  - Describe how to incorporate more molecules. 

This is the list of features already incorporated in the latest versions of the package:

- Allow a system key variable to be specified as a list of values and not only as an interval. [DONE 25/07/24, Jorge Zuluaga]
